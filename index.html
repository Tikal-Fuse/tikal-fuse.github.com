professional software developers and a leading open source service
provider, you are welcome to visit our home page at
<a href="www.tikalk.com" target="_blank">www.tikalk.com</a><br><br>Tikal
Fuse is a reach repository of open source projects and code samples
that we collect in out day to day life and which we are happy to
share with the global open source community.<br>The main intent of
this repository is to serve as an easy bootstrapping tool and a reach
knowledge base for anyone wishing to get up and running quickly with
new developments. or needs a sample on some specific technology.<br><br>The
repository is organized in small projects (each of which is actually
a git repository).<br>The projects are different in nature, some of
them are sample projects that we develop in our monthly workshop
(therefor the name Fuse), some of them are actual projects that we
develop for our own use and share them with you, and some are just
code snippets of very cool stuff, and more and more.<br><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">You will find here projects  written in
different languages, from Java to Scala, .NET(only the unpaid
stuff:)), ruby , python, flex ,django , java script, html .. the list
is long, just go on and <a href="http://github.com/Tikal-Fuse" target="_self">brows</a> the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>most of our fuse projects are not
production quality but are only demonstrating uses and solutions in
some technology or another. In many cases you can use an example as a
template for starting your own development. Where a project is
production quality we will mention that in the project's wiki page.<br>
nevertheless, we do make a big effort
in keeping high coding standards, publish only working and build-able
examples, and documenting our work. please let us know of any bugs we
have, or any suggestions and improvements that you think we should
put into a specific project or to our fuse as a whole.<br><br>feel
free to clone any project and modify as you wish for your own needs,
we publish everything under open source licenses.<br>if you are not
comfortable working with git you can always download a zip/tar
package from the Github project page.</p>
