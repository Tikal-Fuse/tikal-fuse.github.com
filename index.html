            The repository is organized in small projects (each of which is actually a git repository).
            The projects are different in nature, some of them are sample projects that we develop in our monthly
            workshop
            (therefor the name Fuse), some of them are actual projects that we develop for our own use and share them
            with
            you, and some are just code snippets of very cool stuff, and more and more.

            most of our fuse projects are not production quality but are only demonstrating uses and solutions in some
            technology or another. In many cases you can use an example as a template for starting your own development.
            Where a project is production quality we will mention that in the project's wiki page. nevertheless, we do
            make
            a big effort in keeping high coding standards, publish only working and build-able examples, and documenting
            our work. please let us know of any bugs we have, or any suggestions and improvements that you think we
            should
            put into a specific project or to our fuse as a whole.
